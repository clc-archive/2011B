<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>Hello all, I want to 

get your materials up on our website -- PowerPoints, handouts, references to 

documents that were handed out in limited number that day, etc.&nbsp; Let's 

dicuss this on Thursday.&nbsp; If your documents are too large, we can use 

Dropbox or something similar.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>Meanwhile, here are 

some numbers for Saturday's workshop.&nbsp; They look good!:</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<UL>

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>There were 37 

  attending, not counting Peter Paden or&nbsp;HREP staff.&nbsp; That's the 

  second lowest attendance we've had, which I attribute to the Saturday 

  schedule.&nbsp; Our one other Saturday workshop had 34 attending, whereas the 

  Conservation Advisory Council workshop had 57 or 58, and Stormwater had 

  44.&nbsp; We received 34 evaluations, however, and the largest percentage ever 

  -- a good marker.</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>There was a good 

  variety:&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) planning board members, (8) zoning board, and two 

  each of town board members, CAC members, EMC members, and four&nbsp;residents 

  who didn't claim&nbsp;&nbsp; Several attending had two or three 

  affiliations.&nbsp; Their range of experience was also very broad, but leaned 

  toward greater experience, with 24 attendees claiming at least several years 

  involvement in their work to professional level experience.&nbsp; Ten people 

  were new (6) or had just over one year experience (4.)</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>(21) attending said 

  the workshop "met" expectations and (14) said "exceeded" expectations.&nbsp; 

  This compares well against the CAC workshop (33 and 12, respectively.)&nbsp; A 

  total of 24 said that the workshop increased their knowledge to at least one 

  greater level.&nbsp; One with "considerable" knowledget still felt the 

  workshop "exceeded" expectations.&nbsp; The same number said they'd be able to 

  use the knowledge in two or more ways in their town.</SPAN></FONT></LI></UL>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>Here are some 

written comments:</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<UL>

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>would like more on 

  the topic, more in-depth</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>would like the 

  exercise as a workshop in itself</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>something on the 

  State Sanitary Code (2) </SPAN></FONT>

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>would like written 

  materials on this to give to town boards (2)</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>something on 

  hydrofracking, clear cutting of slopes, help with establishing a CAC (no 

  name!)</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>more of the same 

  (basics) and "do it again!"</SPAN></FONT> 

  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><SPAN class=289114215-19032012>something on how to 

  balance "property rights" with conservation issues like these ("too many in 

  the audience are against development."</SPAN></FONT></LI></UL>
